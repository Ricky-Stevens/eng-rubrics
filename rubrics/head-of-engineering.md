# Head of Engineering

Responsible for setting engineering strategy, technical vision, and organisational capability. Provides technical and commercial leadership across multiple teams, ensuring alignment to business goals while maintaining engineering excellence and professional standards.

Candidates should use the **STAR method** (Situation, Task, Action, Result). This assessment is about demonstrated experience, not theoretical understanding.

## A - Knowledge and Understanding
#### **00:10** - UK-SPEC CEng A

The ability to use a combination of general and specialist engineering knowledge to apply original thinking to practical problems. This includes designing complex systems grounded in sound engineering principles that are scalable for future needs.

**What to look for:**

- Application of foundational and advanced engineering principles
- Awareness of scalability, maintainability, and reliability concerns
- Clear justification for architectural and technology choices
- Consideration of future evolution and operational risk
- Use of standards, models, or frameworks (DDD, CAP theorem, microservices)

---

## B - Design, Development and Solving Problems
#### **00:15** - UK-SPEC CEng B

The ability to apply appropriate theoretical and practical methods to analyse and solve engineering problems. This includes systematic diagnosis of issues, evaluation of solution options, and ensuring outcomes meet both technical and business constraints.

**What to look for:**

- Systematic diagnosis (e.g. instrumentation, logging, profiling)
- Evaluation of multiple solutions with trade-off analysis
- Collaboration with stakeholders to validate outcomes
- Use of risk-based thinking in selecting or rejecting options

## C - Responsibility, Management or Leadership
#### **00:20** - UK-SPEC CEng C

The ability to provide technical and commercial leadership and manage the implementation of engineering activities. This includes structuring and evolving engineering teams or practices to ensure consistent technical quality, delivery velocity, and alignment to long-term business goals.

**What to look for:**

- Evidence of engineering strategy and architectural stewardship
- Alignment of team topology to product or platform goals
- Use of operating models (e.g. DORA metrics, tech radars, RFCs)
- Defined quality gates (code reviews, CI/CD, technical design reviews)
- Active development of engineering culture and mentoring

## D - Communication and Interpersonal Skills
#### **00:25** - UK-SPEC CEng D

The ability to communicate effectively with others at all levels and in different roles, and work collaboratively. This includes influencing cross-functional stakeholders on technical approaches and handling communication, disagreement, and decision-making effectively.

**What to look for:**

- Clear articulation of technical trade-offs to non-technical peers
- Use of evidence and structured argumentation
- Adaptation of communication style to the audience
- Constructive resolution of conflict or misalignment
- Effective stakeholder management and negotiation

---

## E - Commitment to Professional Standards
#### **00:30** - UK-SPEC CEng E

The ability to demonstrate personal commitment to professional standards, including ethical practice and continuous professional development. This includes embedding engineering ethics, security, safety, and professional development into teams' day-to-day work.

**What to look for:**

- Proactive enforcement of engineering standards (e.g. secure coding, DR, audits)
- Establishment of a CPD culture (mentoring, learning budgets, career frameworks)
- Attention to legal, regulatory, and ethical considerations (e.g. GDPR, safety-critical systems)
- Accountability and role modelling of professional conduct
