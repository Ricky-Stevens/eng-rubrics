# Chief / Principal Architect

Responsible for the organisation's overall architectural direction, coherence, standards, and long-term technology evolution. Provides high-level technical leadership across domains, guides complex architectural decisions, and ensures alignment between business strategy and technical capability.

Candidates should use the **STAR method** (Situation, Task, Action, Result). This assessment is about demonstrated experience, not theoretical understanding.

- Demonstrated strong integration architecture capability (events, APIs, pipelines, streaming, interoperability)
- Anticipated cross-system impacts (scalability, failure modes, security, data consistency, operational complexity)
- Solved deep-rooted architectural issues (scalability bottlenecks, technical entropy, cross-domain coupling)
- Balanced design trade-offs with operational, financial, organisational, and timeline constraints
- Designed data architectures ensuring consistency, quality, lineage, and governance at enterprise scale
- Led development of organisational systems integration capabilities including automation and CI/CD
