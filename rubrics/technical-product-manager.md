# Technical Product Manager

A Technical Product Manager defines product strategy, manages delivery value, aligns stakeholders, and ensures that technical decisions support business outcomes. Demonstrates strong technical understanding while driving product direction and measurable business results.

Candidates should use the **STAR method** (Situation, Task, Action, Result). This assessment is about demonstrated experience, not theoretical understanding.
