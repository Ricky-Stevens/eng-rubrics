# Enterprise Architect

Responsible for defining and governing the organisation's end-to-end architecture across business, data, applications, and technology. Ensures coherence, strategic alignment, long-term technical sustainability, and value realisation across the enterprise.

Candidates should use the **STAR method** (Situation, Task, Action, Result). This assessment is about demonstrated experience, not theoretical understanding.

## A - Enterprise Strategy & Vision
#### **00:10** - SFIA STPL / ARCH Level 6–7

Developing long-term architectural direction, creating enterprise-wide frameworks, and ensuring alignment between business strategy and technical landscape.

**What to look for:**

- Developed enterprise architecture principles, blueprints, or long-term roadmaps spanning multiple domains
- Ensured architectural alignment across product, platform, data, and infrastructure portfolios
- Translated business strategy into coherent technology direction with clear investment priorities
- Balanced innovation with risk, cost, operational constraints, and organisational maturity
- Influenced executive decision-making using architectural insights, analysis, and strategic options
- Defined target state architecture and migration pathways across multi-year horizons
- Articulated architectural vision that inspired and aligned diverse technical and business stakeholders
- Demonstrated measurable business value from strategic architectural decisions

## B - Architecture Governance & Portfolio
#### **00:15** - SFIA GOVN / POMG / METL Level 5–7

Establishing architecture governance structures, aligning investments to enterprise priorities, and ensuring architectural compliance at scale.

**What to look for:**

- Introduced or led architectural review boards, governance frameworks, or decision-making processes
- Ensured architectural coherence and compliance across complex portfolios (platform, product, data, infrastructure)
- Evaluated solutions for alignment with enterprise principles, standards, and constraints
- Managed architectural risks and dependencies across multiple delivery streams or programmes
- Maintained enterprise roadmaps linking capability evolution to investment decisions
- Established architectural standards, patterns, reference architectures, or guardrails
- Governed selection and adoption of methods, tools, and frameworks at enterprise scale
- Balanced governance rigor with organisational agility and speed of execution

## C - System Design & Integration
#### **00:20** - SFIA DESN / DATM / INOV Level 5–6

Designing complex systems spanning multiple domains, integrating heterogeneous platforms, and solving enterprise-scale technical challenges.

**What to look for:**

- Led design of cross-domain systems (data pipelines, platform integration, event architectures, API strategies)
- Solved deep, long-standing architectural problems with enterprise-wide impact
- Anticipated downstream implications across performance, data flows, security, compliance, and operations
- Used models, diagrams, patterns, or abstractions (C4, ArchiMate, TOGAF views) to communicate complex architectures
- Applied architecture frameworks pragmatically and outcome-driven, not dogmatically
- Designed data architectures ensuring consistency, quality, lineage, and governance at scale
- Enabled innovation through structured experimentation within enterprise constraints
- Delivered architectural solutions that proved robust, scalable, and maintainable in production

## D - Stakeholder Engagement & Influence
#### **00:25** - SFIA RLMT / CNSL Level 5–6

Influencing senior stakeholders, facilitating strategic decisions, and acting as a trusted advisor across the organisation.

**What to look for:**

- Influenced senior engineering, product, commercial, and operational stakeholders on architectural direction
- Provided structured architectural options with clear trade-offs, risk analysis, and cost implications
- Handled disagreement or ambiguity constructively through evidence-based argument and facilitation
- Facilitated multi-team and cross-functional alignment around shared architectural vision
- Acted as trusted strategic advisor on complex technical and organisational decisions
- Tailored communication style and depth to diverse audiences (executives, engineers, business stakeholders)
- Built and maintained credibility through delivery, transparency, and technical authority
- Navigated organisational politics and competing priorities to achieve architectural outcomes

## E - Organisational Capability & Standards
#### **00:30** - SFIA PDSV / PEMT / SCTY Level 5–6

Uplifting architectural capability across teams, embedding professional standards, and integrating security and compliance into architectural practice.

**What to look for:**

- Mentored architects, tech leads, or senior engineers in architectural thinking and decision-making
- Defined or improved architecture competencies, capability frameworks, or career paths
- Ensured security, compliance, and data governance are embedded at design time, not retrofitted
- Facilitated communities of practice, architecture guilds, or enterprise-wide knowledge sharing
- Role-modelled professional standards, ethics, and engineering judgement
- Established security-by-design principles and practices across the architecture lifecycle
- Developed others' capability to make sound architectural decisions autonomously
- Created learning opportunities through architectural reviews, ADR discussions, or design critiques
