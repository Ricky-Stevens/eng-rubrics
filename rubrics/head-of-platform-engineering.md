# Head of Platform Engineering

Responsible for the strategy, reliability, scalability, and operability of the organisation's platform and cloud environments. Leads platform teams, defines operational standards, and ensures platform capabilities enable the organisation's technical goals.

Candidates should use the **STAR method** (Situation, Task, Action, Result). This assessment is about demonstrated experience, not theoretical understanding.
