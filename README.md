## Rubric Structure

Every rubric follows the same format:

- **Page 1:** 5 competency areas with evaluation criteria and behavioural anchors
- **Page 2:** Scoring rubric with seniority thresholds (1–5 scale)

Rubrics define *what* to assess, not *how* to ask. Interviewers choose their own questions using the STAR method.

---

## Framework Alignment

These rubrics are aligned to recognised professional standards:

- [UK-SPEC](https://www.engc.org.uk/standards-guidance/standards/uk-spec/) - UK Standard for Professional Engineering Competence
- [SFIA](https://sfia-online.org/) - Skills Framework for the Information Age
