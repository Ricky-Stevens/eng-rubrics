# How To Use These Rubrics

These rubrics are designed for a **structured 45-minute interview** conducted by **2-3 interviewers**, where each competency area is explored through one opening question in the candidate's choice of interview style. The process is evidence-based, consistent, and defensible.

## Pre-Interview

**Send this to the candidate before the interview:**

> We'll be conducting a structured competency-based interview focused on your professional experience. The interview will be 45 minutes and structured as follows:
>
> - **10 minutes:** Introduction, context about the role, and overview of how the interview works
> - **30 minutes:** Five sections covering key competencies. In each section, we'll ask you about a situation you've faced and how you handled it.
> - **5 minutes:** Your questions for us
>
> **What we're looking for:** Real examples from your career. We use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to understand what you've actually done, not what you'd theoretically do. Come prepared with concrete examples.

## Interview

### **Opening (10 minutes)**

**Objectives:**
- Build rapport and reduce any nervousness
- Frame the role and context
- Explain the interview structure and time allocation

**What to cover:**
1. Brief role overview and what success looks like
2. Interview structure: "We'll work through 5 competency areas. In each one, I'll ask you about a real situation from your experience. Please give us concrete examples - the Situation, what Task you faced, what Actions you took, and the Result."
3. Time allocation: "We have 45 minutes total. Five sections of about 5-6 minutes each. I'll keep us on track so we can cover all areas. We'll make sure you have time at the end for any questions you have for us."
4. Permission to take notes: "I'll be taking notes so I don't forget details. Feel free to ask for clarification at any time."

### **Five Competency Sections (30 minutes)**

For each competency area in the rubric:

**How to ask:** Choose one question from the appropriate **questions file** for your role that matches your interview style . Ask only one opening question and let them speak.

**How to probe:** Use natural follow-ups to understand the full story: "Walk me through what happened next?" "What was the outcome?" "How did that go?" "What would you do differently?" Don't interrupt or judge - let them guide you into their example.

**Time watch:** Each section gets ~5 minutes. If you're ahead on time, use it later. If behind, move on and come back if time permits.

### **Candidate Questions & Close (5 minutes)**

"Do you have any questions for us?" Answer genuinely. Thank them for their time.

## Read the Signals

Interviewers don't just listen to answers. You read signals. Know when to step in, or step back. For detailed behavioral interviewing guidance, see **[INTERVIEW_TIPS.md](INTERVIEW_TIPS.md)**.

### Probe for STAR

- If they give you a vague answer or a hypothetical ("I would probably..."), redirect: "Can you tell me about a specific time this happened?"
- Listen for the four elements: Situation (context), Task (challenge), Action (what they did), Result (what happened/what they learned).
- If they skip the Result, ask: "And what was the outcome?" or "How did that turn out?"

### Let Them Think

Candidates often fill 5–10 seconds of silence with good insights. Don't steal their next thought. Resist the urge to fill the space.

### Give Direction Without Giving Answers

Use diagnostic prompts:
- "What was your reasoning for going that route?"
- "What would you optimize for here?"
- "What could break in this approach?"

Avoid binary questions ("Did you consider X or Y?")-they're less revealing and feel leading.

### Watch What They Don't Say

- Glossing over parts of the story or vague references signal blind spots.
- What's absent is often as revealing as what's present.
- Surface these gaps-they're important to understand now, not later.

### Don't Interrupt or Judge

- Let them finish their example. Slower speakers need space to think and articulate.
- Avoid nodding, verbal cues, or micro-expressions that suggest approval or disapproval. Stay neutral.
- If they go too long, gently refocus: "That's helpful. Can you walk me through what happened next?"

### Respect Their Choice

- If they pick an example slightly outside your probe, that's fine. They're showing what matters to them.
- If they don't have an example in an area, that's data too. Lack of experience is a signal.

## Post-Interview

**After all interviews are complete:**

### **Step 1: Independent Scoring**

Each interviewer reviews the Scoring Matrix in the rubric and assigns a score (1-5) to each competency area based on what they heard.

**Scoring guidance:**
- **1:** No credible example, or deeply misaligned with competency
- **2:** Weak example, limited ownership, questionable judgment
- **3:** Clear example of capability, but with gaps or room for growth
- **4:** Strong example demonstrating consistent capability and good judgment
- **5:** Exceptional example showing sophisticated, nuanced leadership

Reference the rubric's "What to look for" section in each competency. Does their example show evidence of the things listed there?

### **Step 2: Collective Debrief**


**For each competency:**
1. **Highlight alignment or disagreement.** "I scored them 4 on Competency 1, but you scored 3. What did you see different?"
2. **Each interviewer justifies their score:** "I scored them a 3 because they gave a solid example, but they didn't articulate the impact or outcome clearly."
3. **Discuss the evidence:** What did they actually say? How does it map to the rubric criteria?
4. **Converge on a score:** Do you move the 3 to a 4, or do the 4s come down? The goal is thoughtful consensus, not averaging. Use evidence to guide the decision.

### **Step 3: Final Score & Recommendation**

Once you've agreed on scores for all competencies, **total them and refer to the rubric's scoring thresholds** .

**Make a recommendation:**
- **Yes:** Consensus that they meet the bar for the role
- **Maybe:** Close call, want more information (consider another interview, reference check, or trial project)
- **No:** Clear misalignment with competencies

**Document your reasoning:** Write 2-3 sentences per competency explaining your score and flagging any areas of concern or strength.

## Common Questions

**Q: What if the candidate doesn't have an example in one area?**

That's data. If they haven't experienced a particular competency area it indicates lack of demonstrated experience.

**Q: Can we ask follow-up questions outside the five sections?**

Yes. If an answer raises a concern or you want to understand their thinking better, ask follow-up questions within the section's time.

**Q: What if we disagree on the final score?**

That's normal. Discuss the evidence. If one interviewer saw strength in an example the others missed, explore that. 

If there's genuine disagreement, you can document the disagreement to caveat the recommendation.

**Q: Should we give candidates feedback on their score?**

That's your choice. Some orgs share scores; others don't. 

If you do, be prepared to explain what the 1-5 scale means and what would move them higher.
