## Interview Styles

### Open & Conversational
Broad opening that lets the candidate choose their own example. Minimal scaffolding or direction - they pick the situation that matters to them.

*Best for:* Natural flow conversations, discovering what they naturally value and emphasise, seeing their own priorities.

### Concise & Direct
Minimal preamble, straight to the point. Questions are tight and assume the candidate understands what you're asking for.

*Best for:* Efficient interviews, fast-paced discussions, candidates with strong self-direction, interviewer who prefers not to scaffold.

### Guided & Specific
Points toward a particular situation type, but lets them choose their own example. Scaffolded enough to be clear what ground you want to cover.

*Best for:* Ensuring specific competencies are explored, guiding discussion while respecting their choice of example, structured assessment.
