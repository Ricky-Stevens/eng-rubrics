# Interview Tips

This guide helps interviewers conduct high-quality, fair assessments.

## 1. Build Rapport & Reduce Anxiety

Nervous candidates underperform. Your job is to help them succeed so you can assess their actual ability.

### Make It Personal

- Use their name early - it activates familiarity and signals you're engaged with them.
- Show you're human - a brief comment about your day or something relevant from their background.
- Ask a light opening question - it gives them the floor and creates a conversational dynamic, rather than transactional.

### Calm Body Language

- Look engaged, calm, and interested - even in remote settings, micro-expressions matter.
- Make eye contact (or look at the camera) - it communicates that you're paying attention.

### Acknowledge Nervousness

If they're visibly nervous, don't let them suffer in silence. A simple "Most people feel a bit nervous in these interviews - that's completely normal" does wonders.

## 2. Set Clear Expectations & Signpost

Giving a clear structure reduces cognitive load and lets them plan ahead.

### Outline the Agenda Up Front

- "We'll spend 10 minutes introducing ourselves, then work through 5 competency areas. Each section will be about 5 minutes. At the end, you'll have time to ask us any questions."
- Enforce the order - say who will introduce themselves and in what order, so there's no awkward fumbling.
- Explain the format - let them know they can ask for clarification, there's nothing to catch them out, and you're here to help them succeed.

### Make It Two-Way

Ask "How does that sound?" or "Any questions about the process?" to confirm understanding and give them control.

### Watch Their Engagement

While you're explaining the structure, observe them:
- Are they actively listening?
- What body language are they showing?
- Do they take notes?
- Do they ask for clarification?

This tells you something about how they process information under pressure.

### Avoid Abrupt Transitions

Signal any changes in conversation clearly. "Let's move on to the next section..." gives them breathing space to context-switch. Abrupt shifts can feel jarring and add to their cognitive load.

## 3. Introductions

Introductions create a feeling of trust and shift the interview from transactional to conversational.

### Introduce Yourself

- First name, role, time at the company. A small narrative hook - what you work on or what you did before, but don't deliver a monologue.
- If you want them to be concise and strategic in their introduction, be that way in yours.

### Hand Over Explicitly

Don't leave a weird silence. Something like: "I'll now hand over to you for .."

### Encourage Them to Choose What's Relevant

What they choose to highlight is interesting. It signals what they think matters. What they omit matters too.

### Active Listening

- Eye contact, back-channeling, and micro-expressions show genuine interest.
- This isn't passive. You're validating them, building trust, and gathering signals about how they present themselves.

### Make Notes

You'll forget about this bit later, but it's important. It combats recency bias when writing feedback.

## 4. Watch the Process, Not Just the Words

Interviewers don't just listen to answers. You read signals. Know when to step in, or step back.

### What You're Looking For

**Positive signals:**
- They articulate their thinking clearly: "First, I'd..." or "The trade-off here is..."
- They verify assumptions and ask clarifying questions: "Can I clarify what you mean by...?" or "Is the focus on X or Y?"
- They pause to validate direction before going deep: "Is this aligned with what you're looking for?"
- When they hit a blocker, they try a different approach rather than freeze.
- They speak coherently and structure their responses logically.
- They use you as a collaborator, asking useful questions to understand context better.
- They can name trade-offs and describe what they'd do differently - self-awareness is a marker of higher performers.

**Red flags:**
- Charging ahead without clarifying the situation shows poor stakeholder alignment.
- High fluency and confident delivery of a flawed approach can be persuasive - evaluate the substance, not the presentation.
- Vague references like "we'd figure that out later" often mask inexperience.
- Long pauses with no verbal thinking, nervous laughter, circular explanations, or vague monologues suggest confusion or stress.
- Absence of key details usually signals blind spots. Surface these - they're expensive to find later.
- Sudden changes in pace, fidgeting, or disconnection from the task can hint at confusion or confidence loss.

### Read Below the Surface

**Cognitive Load Under Stress**

Stress impairs working memory and inhibits executive function. This is not incompetence; it's human neurology.

- If they repeat themselves or lose the thread, offer clarity: "Let me recap what we've covered..."
- Allow pauses. Silence doesn't always mean they're stuck.
- Don't confuse anxiety with inability.

**Default Behavior Under Pressure**

People revert to familiar patterns when stressed. What they do first often reflects how they work day-to-day.

- If they jump straight to action without planning, that's how they likely work under real deadline pressure.
- If they pause to clarify and structure before diving in, they're probably thoughtful in their day job too.

**Confidence vs. Competence**

High fluency and fast talk can mask shallow understanding. Be aware of affinity bias - we rate people higher when they communicate like us.

- Listen for substance, not polish.
- Look for evidence they can explain their reasoning, not just deliver it.

## 5. When to Step In

### Give Them Space

Candidates often fill 5-10 seconds of silence with good insights. Don't steal their next thought. Resist the urge to fill the space.

### Intervene Only When Necessary

Step in when:
- They misinterpret the core question and show no signs of backtracking
- They go completely off-topic and won't re-engage
- They've gone silent for 30+ seconds with clear signs of stress (the really uncomfortable silences)

### Use Soft, Open-Ended Prompts

Diagnostic prompts give direction without giving answers:
- "What was your reasoning for going down that route?"
- "If this happened again, what would you do differently?"

Avoid binary questions ("Did you do X or Y?") - they don't reveal much and can feel leading.

## 6. Their Questions

What a candidate asks tells you about their curiosity, priorities, and values. This is often the most revealing part of the interview.

### Why This Matters

By the time they ask questions, they've often relaxed. The rapport and trust have been established. Their guard is down. What they ask usually defines their real character, what they genuinely find important, and what they enjoy.

### Reading Their Questions

**They ask about the tech stack, architecture, or technology choices?**
They're intrinsically motivated and likely focused on the technology itself. Less likely to enjoy client-facing or leadership roles.

**They ask about the team, who they'd work with, or team dynamics?**
Social awareness and emotional intelligence. Team-oriented. Good for cross-functional collaboration.

**They ask about company strategy, product vision, or how their role connects to it?**
They're signalling engagement with purpose, not just function. These people are often good leaders.

**They ask about culture, well-being, flexibility, or benefits?**
Not a bad thing - everyone cares about these. But if it's *all* they ask about, you might be getting someone looking for an easy ride, not someone seeking challenge.

**They ask nothing?**
That's a signal. It usually indicates disinterest, fear, lack of preparation, or exhaustion. You told them upfront there would be time for questions - silence is noteworthy.

**They ask genuinely curious, probing questions?**
If they're curious now, they'll be curious later. They'll onboard faster, learn quicker, and push the team forward.

### Trust Your Read

The questions they ask reveal their actual motivations and values. Listen carefully.

## 7. Finishing Strong

Recency bias is real. Their memory of the experience is skewed by the final 2 minutes. Make those minutes count.

### Thank Them Genuinely

Even if you don't think they're a fit, they gave their time. Mean it.

### Summarize What Happens Next

Be clear and concrete: "We'll compare notes, write up our assessments, and send them to [Hiring Manager]. They'll be in touch with next steps." Certainty reduces anxiety.

### Be Warm, Not Committal

- Don't imply outcome. Avoid phrases like "You did great!" or "We loved your thinking."
- Avoid any language that could be misinterpreted as a decision.
- Keep your tone warm and confident. This is their last impression of you.

### Never Give Feedback

Even positive feedback can cause problems. If they ask, politely decline: "It's company policy." is an easy line.

### Your Final Impression Reflects Your Organization

End strong, regardless of outcome. Always leave the door open. You're representing your company, and every candidate tells others about their experience.

---

## 8. Write Good Feedback (And Why It Matters)

Structured feedback reduces bias and improves decision quality.

### Start with Positives

- What went well?
- What did they demonstrate clearly?
- Where were they strongest?

### Next, Considerations

- What areas were less clear or weaker?
- Were any signals ambiguous or missing?
- **Separate nerves from actual skill gaps.** Nerves are not incompetence.
- Use objective language: "Did not clarify the situation" not "Seemed confused."

### Then, Scoring & Recommendation

- Provide the final scores from the rubric, along with the breakdowns for each competency.
- If you're undecided, explain what further signal you'd need.
- Give a recommendation: "Strong yes", "Yes", "No", "Strong no".
